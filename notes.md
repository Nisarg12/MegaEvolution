# Bugs & Notes

- Mega stones can be stolen, swapped, thrown, given or otherwise removed by Thief, Covet, Trick, Switcheroo, Knock Off, Bestow, Fling, etc. Should look at Sticky Hold or Suction Cups to fix. Mail might also hold some answers
- The priority of Mega Evolution is wrong. Currently it occurs right before the attack happens, however the priority in Generation 6 is different. More investigation is required.
- Primal Evolutions have not been added.
